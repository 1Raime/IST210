        "Our team created FLIXNET in order to provide users with an affordable and accessible streaming service. Unlike our competition, FLIXNET is dedicated in making sure our users can find what they are looking for in an effective and efficient manner. We have designed our database in a way in which our users can find any movie or TV show they are looking for and can narrow down their search options in a multitude of ways.  We began creating our database by choosing our 5 main entities (Moves, TV, Actors, DVDs, and Users) and revolved all of our attributes around these primary categories within the database. This allowed for us to create a entity-relationship diagram that provides us with a baseline for the components of our database.\n"

She navigates her way to the “Movie” section of Flixnet. Mary is in the mood to watch a funny movie, so she browses the comedy genre. She finds a movie starring her favorite actor, but notices that Flixnet shows that it is rated R. Since Mary is with her family, she decides to not choose that movie.
